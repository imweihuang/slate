# Introduction

Welcome to the Kyber Network documentation! You can find our documentation for smart contracts and APIs here. You can visit our GitHub [here](https://github.com/KyberNetwork). 

Kyber Network functions as a decentralized Ethereum-based solution that is committed to advancing the interchangeability and fluidity of digital asset conversion.

Our trustless system offers a convenient and secure platform that empowers users with flexibility and choice when it comes to token exchange and payment. With our system, users will be able to make or receive payments in the token of their choice seamlessly, without ever dealing with the hassle of deposits or registration. Trade requests and payments are executed instantly and securely at the best possible rate, free from the vulnerability threats and slow processing time that burden other existing exchanges.

To help expand our network, we have made it so that our open-source technology can be easily integrated to facilitate cross-platform trading and payment, which will help unlock more token utility and adoption. The meteoric rise of cryptocurrency has ushered in multiple waves of new digital assets. The rising diversity of tokens begs for a Paypal-like structure to help blockchain transition from concept to real-world application – and we are confident that Kyber Network is the key to enabling the technology’s full potential.
